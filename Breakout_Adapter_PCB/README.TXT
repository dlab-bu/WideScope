BREAKOUT ADAPTER PCB
____________________

We use lightweight Hirose connectors to interface between the miniscope 
and the image data and LED power cables.  The Hirose connectors in turn
are mounted on small breakout PCBs for ease of soldering.

The files here can be used to fabricate the PCB boards through 
commercial vendors.
