The .STL files here can be used to print the housing for the main scope body.   

The '_UCLA' and '_Ximea' versions are identical apart from the platform that holds the sensor chip - use the version that matches your hardware plans. Both have a 4.5 mm aperture at the center of the optical path.

The '_LensCover' file is identical for both designs and fits above the lens elements after they have been loaded into the housing.
