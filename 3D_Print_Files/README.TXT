The .STL files here can be used to print the housing for the main scope body.   

The '_UCLA' and '_Ximea' versions are identical apart from the platform that holds the sensor chip - use the version that matches your hardware plans. Both have a 4.5 mm aperture at the center of the optical path.

The '_LensCover' file is identical for both designs and fits above the lens elements after they have been loaded into the housing.  

We have printed using Formlabs Form2 and Form3, using black resin.

Washing and curing steps significantly impact the quality of the final scope.  While not strictly necessary, the post-processing systems offered by FormLabs simplify these steps.

Other printers and/or materials have not been tested.  Print resolution, weight, and lightproofing/autofluorescence will be the key factors for other print systems.
