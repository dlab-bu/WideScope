3D PRINT FILES
______________


The .STL files here can be used to print the housing for the main scope body.   

The '_UCLA' and '_Ximea' versions are identical apart from the platform that holds the sensor chip.
Use the version that matches your hardware needs. 

The '_UCLA' version has a 4.5 mm aperture at the center of the optical path, 
giving maximal light collection but at the expense of reduced resolution at the FOV edges,
which has little impact given the pixel count for this sensor.

The '_Ximea' version has a 3.0 mm aperture at the center of the optical path, 
maintaining relatively efficient light collection while improving resolution at the FOV edges
for high-pixel-count cellular resolution imaging.

The single '_LensCover' file is used for both designs.
Two of these covers fit above the lens elements after they are loaded into the housing.  

We have successfully printed using Formlabs Form2 and Form3, using black resin.

Washing and curing steps significantly impact the quality of the final scope.  
While not strictly necessary, the post-processing systems offered by FormLabs simplify these steps.

Other printers and/or materials have not been tested.  
Key factors for other print systems will include print resolution, weight, and lightproofing/autofluorescence.
