## Overview

Miniaturized microscopes for head-mounted fluorescence imaging are powerful tools for visualizing neural activity during naturalistic behaviors, but the restricted field of view of first-generation ‘miniscopes’ can limit the size of neural populations accessible for imaging. This page describes a design for a miniaturized 'mesoscope' allowing cellular-resolution imaging over areas spanning several millimeters in freely moving mice. 

## Components

The design is based on a 3-D printed housing combined with off-the-shelf optical components available from commercial suppliers. It can be implemented with different sensor options depending on experimental needs.
