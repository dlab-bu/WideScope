ACQUISITION CODE
________________

The MATLAB code here allows for synchronized acquisition of neural imaging data 
and behavioral video, with associated timestamps.

Imaging data can be captured by any software that recognizes the 
UCLA sensor:    UVC / winvideo
Ximea sensor:   

We find solid-state drives are typically necessary for streaming data to disk
at typical frame rates.

The user interface is started by running:
