ACQUISITION CODE
________________

The MATLAB code here allows for synchronized acquisition of neural imaging data 
and behavioral video, with associated timestamps.

Imaging data can be captured by any software that recognizes the corresponding video sources.
Matlab will require the Image Acquisition toolbox installed, along with the 3rd party support packages:
UCLA sensor:    UVC / winvideo
Ximea sensor:   GenTL

Solid-state drives are highly recommended for streaming data to diskat typical frame rates.

The user interface is started by running:
fcnVidAcqV3_Main
